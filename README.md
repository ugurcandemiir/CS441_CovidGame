# Homework : 

For your first "game" -- at this point, you should have a clear idea what you want to do, and have started on it.  There's a lot of freedom; make something you're interested in making.

Plan to have

An opening/title screen (maybe with buttons for "play" and "instructions")
An instruction screen -- tell people how to play
The actual game -- anything you want
A high score/leaderboard screen.  Keep track of scores across multiple starts of the app


# The application idea : 
 
 I wanted to write an arcade game about Covid 19, which is the problem of today. As a player, I put a vaccine icon and designed the incoming objects as microbes. Covid 19 vaccine is trying to kill incoming microbes. For now, I have only been able to apply the playground and microbes. The next step is to get the player to fire. In this way, he will kill the germs that come across and continue the game.
 I will also add a startup screen at the same time. Then, I will briefly tell the user how the game is played and start the game. Finally, I am thinking of making a leaderboard where the scores are kept.
